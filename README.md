# About
 This a simple project for searching and viewing photos from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a>, viewing detailed information, adding to    favorites and also with the ability to save photos to your device.

 Requests previously entered into the search are saved in UserDefaults and are unloaded from there randomly when the application starts or if you do a "pull-refresh".
